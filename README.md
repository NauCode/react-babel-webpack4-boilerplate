# react-babel-webpack4-boilerplate
It is just a basic boilerplate I made to quickly start coding my prototypes using React.JS, Babel and Webpack 4.

## Extra Features
It comes with some extra features:
- Support SASS files
- Uses Preact (check that awesome thing [here](https://github.com/preactjs/preact))
- More to come!

## How to use?
Just clone the repo (or download it), rename the folder and the project name in package.json and execute npm install so the dependencies are installed.

Have fun!
